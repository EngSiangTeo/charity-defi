### Problem Statement

Current donation process does not provide much information as to how the funds are used after they are donated to charities. Charity-defi aims to improve the transparency of the flow of funds in the current donation process through blockchain, which will prevent funds from being misused and gives a greater assurance to the donors that their donations are put to good use.
